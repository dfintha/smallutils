Small Utility Repository
========================

This repository contains some small single-source-file utilities I've written
over time. Each file in the 'src' directory is a utility. By using the 'make'
command, the utilities are compiled (or copied in case of interpreted languages)
to the bin directory, ready to use.

The following tools are maintained in the repository.
- bf: A simple brainfuck interpreter.
- pwgen: A password generator.
- bmi: A body mass index calculator.
- fire: A simple fire animation, with a technique taken from Final DOOM.
- vigenere: A very simplistic implementation of the Vigen√®re cipher.
