Small Utility Repository
========================

This repository contains some small single-source-file utilities I've written
over time. Each file in the 'src' directory is a utility. By using the 'make'
command, the utilities are compiled (or copied in case of interpreted languages)
to the bin directory, ready to use.

The following tools are maintained in the repository.
- bf: Brainfuck interpreter.
- pwgen: Password generator.
- bmi: Body mass index (BMI) calculator.
- fire: Simple fire animation, with a technique taken from Final DOOM.
- vigenere: Naive implementation of the Vigen√®re cipher.
- pdfcompress: Small script to reduce PDF file sizes using Ghostscript.
- autoclick: Auto-clicking tool.
- hexstrdump: Tool to dump file contents as hex-formatted C strings.
