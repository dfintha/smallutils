Small Utility Repository
========================

This repository contains some small single-source-file utilities I've written
over time. Each file in the 'src' directory is a utility. By using the 'make'
command, the utilities are compiled (or copied in case of interpreted languages)
to the bin directory, ready to use.

The following tools are maintained in the repository.
- bf: Brainfuck interpreter.
- pwgen: Password generator.
- bmi: Body mass index (BMI) calculator.
- fire: Simple fire animation, with a technique taken from Final DOOM.
- vigenere: Naive implementation of the Vigen√®re cipher.
- pdfcompress: Small script to reduce PDF file sizes using Ghostscript.
- autoclick: Auto-clicking tool.
- hexstrdump: Tool to dump file contents as hex-formatted C strings.
- htmlm: HTML with Macros processor.
- albumtagger: Tool to tag whole albums consisting of MP3 files.
- htmlvis: HTML visualizer via dot/graphviz.
- bunnies: A simple animation of two bunnies with a heart between them.
- cats: A simple animation of two cats sitting on a fence, originally found in
        Windows 8 builds. For more information, visit Raymond Chen's blog at
        'https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20220208-00/?p=106232'.
- mediacontrol: A media control server, which provides a web interface to
                skip tracks and look at the lyrics.
